  Can be done online or on our personal computer.
  
  [train_colab](https://github.com/IITBRacing/Object-Detection-20---21-DV/tree/master/training/train_colab) contains a jupiter notebook which can be used to train our network online on google colab. Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs. 
  
  [train_local](https://github.com/IITBRacing/Object-Detection-20---21-DV/tree/master/training/train_local) this folder contains codes and describes how to train your netowrk locally
  
  [test](https://github.com/IITBRacing/Object-Detection-20---21-DV/tree/master/training/testin) contains codes that help you test the trained network
