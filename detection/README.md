This directory consists of codes to detect objects in images and videos, 
  
   ```bash
image_detect.py is used to detect objects in pictures
video_detect.py is used to detcet objects in video in almost real time on GPU
yolov3-tiny.cfg, yolov3-tiny.weights are network files for better FPS but doesn't detect all objects
```
    

Both the codes are written with appropriate comments

coco.names contains the names of objects that this netork is trained to detect
